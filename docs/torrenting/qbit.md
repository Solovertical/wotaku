## Torrent Creator

The torrent creator is used to generate **.torrent** files that let you download files from a tracker. This guide is generalized, so **read the rules of your tracker before uploading to see if they have any tracker specific rules.**

___

#### Steps
- Press `Ctrl + N` to open up the **Torrent Creator**.
- Select the file or folder you wanna upload.
- You should adjust the piece size in order to keep the piece count between 1000 and 2000.
- Depending on your tracker, check the Private tracker option.
- Check **Optimize Alignment** and keep it **Disabled**
- Add your announce URL given by the tracker in **Tracker URLs**. For public trackers, it's the same for everyone. For PTs, you get a personal announce URL, which you should keep private. Note that you should only add the announce URLs for the specific tracker you are uploading to. If one tracker has multiple announce URLs, add each in a new line.
- Comment field gets filled by the tracker with the exact torrent URL.
- Source field can have a tracker-specific requirement, or it can be fully optional.
- Click on **Create** and set the destination.
