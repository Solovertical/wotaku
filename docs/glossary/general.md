## Idol / VTuber terms
| Terms     | Meaning { class="compact" }  |
| ------  | ------ |
| Idol | Idols are live entertainers who are expected to be 'Seiso' or pure, meaning they do not engage in romantic relationships. Their primary goal is to entertain their fans. Idol culture is particularly popular in Asia, especially Japan and Korea. Idols are usually local, but occasionally, they can be foreigners too. <br> However, the idol culture can be dark and questionable, despite being portrayed as glamorous in anime and manga. Idol groups can be a girls or boys group. Example: [AKB48](https://www.akb48.co.jp/). Nowadays, VTuber groups such as [Hololive](https://www.youtube.com/@hololive) are managed as an idol group. |
| VTuber | A content creator, typically a streamer, who utilizes a 2D or 3D avatar instead of appearing as themselves. However, it is becoming increasingly common for VTubers to reveal themselves on social media or during streams. This often depends on the policies of the managing agency. |
| Oshi | One's favourite idol. Also known as bias. |
| Gachikoi / Riako | The fan himself. It's generally used when the affection is on a serious level. |
| Kamioshi | If someone has more than one oshi, then his/her most favourite oshi is known as kamioshi. |
| DD / Daredemo Daisuki | Literally means "I like everyone". Used when one likes everyone in the idol group. |
| Chika Idol | Underground Idol. |
| Corpo / Corporate VTuber | A VTuber under contract with an agency is known as a corporate VTuber. |
| Indie / Independent VTuber | If she/he is not under any sort of contract. |
| Oshi Mark | It's used to indicate an idol or VTuber. It can be based by their name, their VTuber model, inside joke or just random. For example, [**Hoshimachi Suisei**](https://www.youtube.com/@HoshimachiSuisei)'s oshi mark is :comet:. It's because the term "Suisei (彗星)" means comet. [**Ninomae Ina'nis**](https://www.youtube.com/@NinomaeInanis)'s :octopus: because of her model. |
| Graduation | When an idol or VTuber bids farewell to their fans. This can happen for various reasons, such as a change in goals, lack of progress, or management issues. <br> Graduation is generally viewed positively. However, if the idol or VTuber breaks any rules, depending on the severity, they may be terminated from the group, which is viewed much more negatively. Many corporate VTubers return to their past persona or adopt a new model to stream again, either as an indie or with a different corporation. |
| PL / Past life | Refers to a VTuber's previous streaming activities, which can include another VTubing account or IRL streaming. Generally, discussing a VTuber's past life on stream or in servers is not appreciated, although there are exceptions." |
