# Madokami Guide


[Madokami](https://manga.madokami.al/) is a private website that hosts manga, novels and artbooks. They upload the same manga rips found on nyaa without compression. You can either download from their site (upto 3 parallel downloads) or directly read in [mihon & their forks](#mihon-forks) using [Keiyoushi repo](https://keiyoushi.github.io/docs/guides/getting-started#adding-the-extension-repo) extension. Open registrations are closed, but you can always join their IRC channel and try your luck at gacha rolling for an account.

## Creating Account

:::info IRC Clients
Install an IRC client, [**HexChat**](https://hexchat.github.io/) if PC and [**Revolution IRC**](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.mrarm.irc/) if Android. You can't use web IRC clients. You can find more clients [**here**](https://ircv3.net/software/clients).
:::


### Step 1

Connect to **Rizon IRC network**.
1. Add nickname for your account
2. Select Rizon in the network list
3. Click Edit
4. Enable **Use SSL for all the servers  on this network**
5. Enable **Accept invalid SSL certificates**
6. Click Close
7. Click Connect

:::details For Revolution IRC

![](/ss/mado/rirc.png)

By default, Revolution IRC doesn't list any networks, so you will need to add Rizon manually by following these steps:
1. Tap the :mdi-plus-circle: button in the bottom right corner of the screen
2. Set network name as `Rizon`
3. Set server address as `irc.rizon.net`
4. The port used is `6697` by default, set it to `9999` in case of connection issues
5. **Enable** SSL/TLS
6. Set your desired nickname
7. Save the configuration
8. You will now see the Rizon network on the main screen. Click on it to start the joining process

:::


### Step 2

::: warning Important
- Use a real e-mail address. Temporary and throw-away e-mail addresses are not acceptable.
- Check spam/junk folder too, if you don't see any reply in the inbox.
- Make sure that your password is longer than 5 characters
:::

1. Register your current nickname by typing the following: `/msg NickServ REGISTER yourPassword your@email.address`
2. Now you should get a confirmation code like this

![](/ss/mado/rzncnfrm.png)

3. Copy and paste the confirmation code into the following command: `/msg NickServ CONFIRM ConfirmationCodeFromEmail`


Now, your nickname is registered, and you've automatically been identified. You are eligible to join Madokami.
Upon your next visit to Rizon IRC network, use the same nickname, and identify using the following command: `/msg NickServ IDENTIFY yourPassword`

### Step 3

1. Type `/join #madokami` at the bottom command bar to join Madokami channel.
2. Now type `/msg sola REGISTER username password` in the Madokami channel. You shouldn't reuse the RIZON password here.

If everything worked, you will now see a **sola** tab on the left (or at the top on Android). Clicking on it, you will find the bot's reply. If it says that you aren't favored, you can try again after about **4 hours**.

::: warning Possible Issues
If you've followed this guide perfectly, but still aren't getting a reply from sola in the side tab, try the following:
- Remove any special symbols from your nick, leaving only letters and numbers, or use a more unique nick (in case someone else already registered it).
- If you're using mobile data, switch to wi-fi.

### Mihon forks

1. Add the [Keiyoushi repo](https://keiyoushi.github.io/docs/guides/getting-started#adding-the-extension-repo) in your Mihon forks.
2. Go to the extension list and search **Madokami**.
3. Install the extension and go to its settings page.
4. Add your login credentials.
5. Now go to the Source page and click on Madokami to read/download the available manga.

::: warning WEBP issue
The Madokami extension by Keiyoushi uses Madokami's web reader instead of downloading the files like other downloaders (so that you can load the manga page by page). Madokami's web reader can't read `.webp` files, resulting in errors in Mihon and its forks as well.
